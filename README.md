# Painting a Wall

1. Prompt the user to input a wall's height and width. Calculate and output the wall's area.

```
Enter wall height (feet):
12
Enter wall width (feet):
15
Wall area: 180 square feet
```

2. Extend to also calculate and output the amount of paint in gallons needed to paint the wall. Assume a gallon of paint covers 350 square feet. Store this value using a const double variable.  The output for the amount of paint needed should be displayed rounded to 2 digits after the decimal (i.e., use **printf**).

```
Enter wall height (feet):
12
Enter wall width (feet):
15
Wall area: 180 square feet
Paint needed: 0.51 gallons
```

3. Extend to also calculate and output the number of 1 gallon cans needed to paint the wall. Hint: Use a math function to round up to the nearest gallon. (2 pts)

```
Enter wall height (feet):
12
Enter wall width (feet):
15
Wall area: 180 square feet
Paint needed: 0.51 gallons
Cans needed: 1 can(s)
